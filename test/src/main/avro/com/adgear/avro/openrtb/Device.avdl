/**
3.3.10 Device Object
The “device” object provides information pertaining to the device including its hardware, platform, location, and carrier. This device can refer to a mobile handset, a desktop computer, set top box or other digital device.
The device object itself and all of its parameters are optional, so default values are not provided. If an optional parameter is not specified, it should be considered unknown.
In general, the most essential fields are either the IP address (to enable geo-lookup for the bidder), or providing geo information directly in the geo object.
