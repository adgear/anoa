/**
3.3.6 App Object
An “app” object should be included if the ad supported content is part of a mobile application (as opposed to a mobile website). A bid request must not contain both an “app” object and a “site” object.
The app object itself and all of its parameters are optional, so default values are not provided. If an optional parameter is not specified, it should be considered unknown. At a minimum, it’s useful to provide an App ID or bundle, but this is not strictly required.
