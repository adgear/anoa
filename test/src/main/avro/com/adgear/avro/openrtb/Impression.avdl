/**
3.3.2 Impression Object
The “imp” object describes the ad position or impression being auctioned. A single bid request can include multiple “imp” objects, a use case for which might be an exchange that supports selling all ad positions on a given page as a bundle. Each “imp” object has a required ID so that bids can reference them individually. An exchange can also conduct private auctions by restricting involvement to specific subsets of seats within bidders.
