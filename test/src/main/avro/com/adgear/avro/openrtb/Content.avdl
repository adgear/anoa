/**
3.3.7 Content Object
The content object itself and all of its parameters are optional, so default values are not provided. If an optional parameter is not specified, it should be considered unknown. This object describes the content in which the impression will appear (may be syndicated or non- syndicated content).
This object may be useful in the situation where syndicated content contains impressions and does not necessarily match the publisher’s general content. The exchange might or might not have knowledge of the page where the content is running, as a result of the syndication method. (For example, video impressions embedded in an iframe on an unknown web property or device.)
