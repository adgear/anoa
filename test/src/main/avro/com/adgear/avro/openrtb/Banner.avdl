/**
3.3.3 Banner Object
The “banner” object _must_ be included directly in the impression object if the impression offered for auction is display or rich media, or it may be _optionally_ embedded in the video object to describe the companion banners available for the linear or non-linear video ad. The banner object may include a unique identifier; this can be useful if these IDs can be leveraged in the VAST response to dictate placement of the companion creatives when multiple companion ad opportunities of the same size are available on a page.
